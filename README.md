##Wasabi
A Web Framework
------------------

####Description

A Web Framework built with [Kotlin](http://kotlin.jetbrains.org). 

Wasabi combines the expressivness of Kotlin, with the power of Netty and the simplicity of Express.js (and other Sinatra inspired web frameworks)
to provide an easy to use HTTP framework

####What it is
An HTTP framework that allows you to easily create back-end services for a web application or any other type of application that 
might require an HTTP API.

####What it is not
It is not an MVC framework. There is no View Engine or templating language. You can combine it with client-side frameworks such 
as AngularJS or Ember. If you want a fully-fledged MVC framework in Kotlin, take a look at [Kara](http://www.karaframework.com)
